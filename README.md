# Failure Prediction Model
Maximise Energy Company's Profits through Data Science

## Objective and Focus
Machine Learning techniques to be used to predict part failures before they can occur

## Data Profile
- Weather data | For each site
- Site and Sensor data 
- Revenue data | For each site
- Repair costs | For each part repaired in the past (Available only in training data)
